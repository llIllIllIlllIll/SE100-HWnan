## What is a Front-end test
Front-end Testing is testing or verifying the frontend **functionality, GUI, and Usability**.
## What can I use
Jasmine, Selenium, Browser, TestComplete, Needle are some of the examples of **Frontend testing tool**.
## Jasmine
>Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.
## About this homework
The index.html and js files are homework from a javascript tutorial book. SpecRunner.html is a demo given by Jasmine tutorial and applied to my own code.
## How to use
[index.html](index.html) shows you a front-end application which allows you to enter username and password for a new account. [SpecRunner.html](SpecRunner.html) shows you the result of unit test on function checkUsername(), which warns you when username is less than 5 characters.
